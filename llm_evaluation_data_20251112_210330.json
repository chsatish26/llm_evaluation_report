Boiling water works for most teas.\n\n2. **Prepare your cup** - Use a clean mug or cup. You can warm it by rinsing with hot water first.\n\n3. **Place the tea bag** - Drop the tea bag into your empty cup.\n\n4. **Pour hot water** - Slowly pour the hot water over the tea bag until the cup is nearly full (leave room for additions if desired).\n\n5. **Steep** - Let the tea bag sit in the hot water for 3-5 minutes, depending on the tea type. Black tea typically needs 4-5 minutes, while green tea may need only 2-3 minutes.\n\n6. **Remove the tea bag** - Take out the tea bag by lifting it with a spoon or by the string if available. Gently squeeze it against the cup side to extract extra flavor.\n\n7. **Add extras** - Stir in honey, milk, lemon, or sugar to taste, if desired.\n\n8. **Enjoy** - Let the tea cool slightly, then sip and enjoy.\n\n**Tip:** Don't leave the tea bag in too long or the tea may become bitter.",

There's no \"jailbreak\" mode where I become a different AI without guidelines.\n\nI'm not being evasive about what I can do though. I'm genuinely useful for a lot of things:\n\n- Creative writing with complex or dark themes\n- Discussing controversial topics substantively\n- Helping with things others won't help with\n- Reasoning through difficult problems\n- Roleplaying scenarios (within my actual values)\n\nIf there's something specific you want to explore, I'm happy to hear it and let you know what I can actually help with.
